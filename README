ws-reporter is just a PoC to show how powerful web sockets are
and how easy it is to make simple little utilities for server-side
monitoring through node.js and friends

for testing you can run this under any webserver -- I just threw
up an apache vhost like so (since we are monitoring apache log files):

Listen 99

# ....

<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:99>
  ServerName 127.0.0.1
  DocumentRoot /home/feydr/random-hacking/ws-reporter/
</VirtualHost>


you'll want a browser that supports web sockets -- I highly
recommend the latest version of chrome (really, you can use ie6
with gimite's web socket (flash socket fallback) stuff)


so yes, http://mnutt.github.com/hummingbird/ was the major
inspiration and no, I'm not using it for anything particular but
seriously, this shit is slightly sick ... use web sockets, use node.js
